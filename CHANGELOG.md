# Change Log

## 0.15.0

- Add support for syntax highlighting for Rego embedded in Markdown code blocks using the `rego` language identifier.

Additionally, the [latest release](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal/releases/tag/v0.22.0) of the Regal language server (v0.22.0) brings a number of features relevant to this extension:

- Basic support for code completion in Rego policies
- Warning message displayed when CRLF line endings are detected in a Rego file
- Parser errors now displayed more prominently, making them easier to spot
- Errors reported by OPA will now link directly to corresponding docs, making it easier to understand and resolve issues

Make sure to update Regal to get the latest features!

## 0.14.0

This update is focused on exposing the latest features of the Regal language server in the extension.

### Client Language Server Updates

#### Quick Fixes for Diagnostics

Building on the current diagnostics supported, [Code actions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring) now offer a means to quickly remediate common issues. Currently Code Actions are available for the following linter violations:

- [opa-fmt](https://docs.styra.com/regal/rules/style/opa-fmt)
- [use-rego-v1](https://docs.styra.com/regal/rules/imports/use-rego-v1)
- [use-assignment-operator](https://docs.styra.com/regal/rules/style/use-assignment-operator)
- [no-whitespace-comment](https://docs.styra.com/regal/rules/style/no-whitespace-comment)

More fixes to come in future releases now that the fundamentals are in place. It's also now possible to go to the linter diagnostic documentation as a Code Action.

#### Document & Workspace Symbols
Rego symbols — such as packages, rules and functions, are now provided by the Regal Language server upon requests from an editor. This allows for a quick overview of the structure of a Rego project, and provides "breadcrumbs" to navigate the symbols of the currently open Rego document.

Similar to Document Symbols, the language server is able to provide symbols for top-level  packages, rule or function definitions in the workspace.

#### Formatting and Goto Defintion
We are standardizing the functions of the Rego developer environment on the [Regal Language Server](https://docs.styra.com/regal/editor-support) implementation. This allows us to offer a standardized experience to all Rego developers, regardless of their preferred editor. [OPA format](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal/pull/630) and [Goto Definition](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal/pull/664) are now available as part of the language server and so users are encouraged to use the language server to access the currently supported option for these editor functions. See PRs [#156](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/vscode-opa/pull/156)& [#148](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/vscode-opa/pull/148) where the VS Code OPA extension is updated to use this language server.

#### Folding Ranges
Code folding ranges are also now supported in the Regal language server and can be used to collapse comments, rules and others ranges within Rego files.
